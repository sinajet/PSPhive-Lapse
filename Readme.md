# PS-Phive\! + Lapsy Host for PS4

A simple and effective host for the PS-Phive\! + Lapsy exploit, designed for PlayStation 4 consoles on firmwares **7.00 to 9.60**.

This project is currently in a **test phase**, but it provides a stable environment for applying the exploit.

## 📝 To-Do List

Here are the planned fixes and improvements for the future:

  * [ ] **Fix Offline Cache:** Implement a reliable offline caching solution so the exploit can be run without an internet connection.
  * [ ] **Fix Binloader:** Repair the payload loader (`binloader`) to ensure smooth payload delivery to the console.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get the host running and test it on your console, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
3.  **Run the Server:**
    Execute the Python server script. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
    ```bash
    python serv.py
    ```
4.  **Connect Your PS4:**
    On your PS4, go to `Settings` \> `Network` \> `Set Up Internet Connection`. Use your computer's IP address as the primary DNS and leave the secondary DNS as `0.0.0.0`. Go to the `User's Guide` in the settings menu to launch the host.
